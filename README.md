#DESCRIPTION

To my surprise, this code has stayed on my hard disk for 5 years so I think I'd better put it on github. 

This code implements a paper [1], which won the best paper award in BigMine 2012. 

The code is easy to read and hopefully it may benefit others' research. However, note that this code was written in 2011 and relied on pretty old versions of hadoop and dumbo. 


#INSTALLATION

There is no need to compile or install the codes in this package.
To run the program, please make sure the settings in the script files
are correctly set. Especially those with the '?=' marks.


#REQUIREMENTS

This code uses third-party softwares/packages as follows:
- Hadoop 0.21.0   
- Dumbo library 0.21.31   


# DATA SETS

The data sets evaluted in our paper are not included in this code package. 
One may download them from SNAP network analysis library 
(http://snap.stanford.edu/data/).
